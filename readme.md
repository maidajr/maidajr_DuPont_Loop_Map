When I was young I would go mountain biking with my father almost every weekend. It quickly became one of my favorite things to do and was always something to look foward to with joy and anticipation at the end of the week. While I was home in Asheville for Spring Break of 2020 and COVID was just beginning to touchdown in the States, I decided to plan out a route go on a solo bike ride to clear my mind of the mass hysteria taking hold as the pandemic began to unfold.
This is a map of that small 10-mile solo mountain bike ride I did in DuPont State Recreational Forest back in March of 2020. I orginially had planned to go on another route only to find out some of the trails had been closed. I ended up planning my own which you can find here on the Trailforks website (https://www.trailforks.com/route/jake-s-dupont-route/). You take off from the Lake Imaging parking Lot and go for a small loop around the Northwestern portion of DuPont Forest. Complete with the mandatory Ridgeline downhill section at the end of course, (iykyk).
